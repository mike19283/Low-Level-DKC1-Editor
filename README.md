# Low-Level-DKC1-Editor
I'm working on a low level dkc editor... Does anybody know how to go from snes tile to image in c#? I already have an object mover. I am not interested in cameras, bananas, etc. Right now I have it so levels will break if you aren't careful. This doesn't properly order objects. This is essentially a glorified hex editor.
